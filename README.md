<h1>Visual C#</h1>

This library implements functionality very similar to RGSS (Ruby Game Scripting System) which is used by Ruby in RPG Maker XP/VX Ace. This was just an experiment to mimick RGSS's functionality in C#. Although I'm not working on it anymore, I wanted to make it open source and I'll likely accept bug fixes.
